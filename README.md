A simple 3D Object Tracking module for humans

## Code Requirements 🦄
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

##### pip install requirements.txt

## Description 👟
This module is a mobile real-time 3D object detection solution for everyday objects. It detects objects in 2D images, and estimates their poses through a machine learning (ML) model, trained on the Objectron dataset.

Object detection is an extensively studied computer vision problem, but most of the research has focused on 2D object prediction. While 2D prediction only provides 2D bounding boxes, by extending prediction to 3D, one can capture an object’s size, position and orientation in the world, leading to a variety of applications in robotics, self-driving vehicles, image retrieval, and augmented reality. Although 2D object detection is relatively mature and has been widely used in the industry, 3D object detection from 2D imagery is a challenging problem, due to the lack of data and diversity of appearances and shapes of objects within a category.

## Python  Implementation 👨‍🔬

**Supported Objects**
